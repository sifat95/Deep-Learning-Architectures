# Deep-Learning-Architecture

## What has been done?
- Model implementation from Paper - AlexNet, ResNet, InceptionNet 
- Integrate Train and Test workflows into MLOPs Pipeline. [Here](./MLOps-Basic-Pipeline/) is the implementation.
- Complete Coursera Course [Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network/home/welcome)
- Hyperparameter Tuning and Compare Model performance [in progress]. The evaluation results can be seen from [this excel sheet](./Model%20performance%20evaluation.xlsx).
